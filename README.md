**Machine Learning Model: Loan Default Prediction for Home Equity Loans**

Built a classification model used to minimize the bank's financial profit loss. After testing and training 3 models, the Tuned Randon Forest becomes the most impactful model able to predict which clients are likely to default on their loan (due to high recall rate) and is interpretable enough to provide reasoning for approving or rejecting their application. Using EDA, we can understand important features to consider during approval process to ensure banks maintain a healthy loan porfolio.
